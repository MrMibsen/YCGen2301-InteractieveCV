# Final Fantasy VII menu

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/XaelGa/pen/rqYZNP](https://codepen.io/XaelGa/pen/rqYZNP).

It began as a just CSS practice trying to imitate the game menu and ended as an almost perfect HD copy of it.
*Sound is slower and load time was increased in CodePen version because I don't have  hosting server to configure lowlag.js and images and music are not here.
*Is counting and saving the time you have "played" in your local storage.
*Play FFVII if you have the opportunity.
